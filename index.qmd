Welcome to the CSPH Data Science Documentation! This website is your go-to resource for learning about data science practices, tools, and projects with the Climate Smart Public Health group. Here you'll find guides, tutorials, and documentation to help you get started and stay informed.

This website is built on Quarto, which is a handy open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto makes it easy to create beautiful, interactive, and reproducible documents and websites using Markdown, code, and visualizations. To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.
